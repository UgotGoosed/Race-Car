## Analysis Steps

This section should restate the assignment and explain how you analyzed the requirements in order 
to develop a solution.

This assignment had me draw a car and then move it across the screen. 
I will have to draw a car in the pane.
Set starting point which is left tire.
Use timeline to move the car object across the screen
Set the starting speed of the car
set increase and decrease buttons to increase and decrease speed of car object.

### Design

How did you approach your program design? Did you use multiple classes to define various objects?

First I needed to draw the car
started with the wheels 
drew the body
drew the top of the car
used a class for the methods to make car, move the car, and create a cycle of the car moving across the screen

### Testing

Drew the left tire and got it to the appropriate size.
set the whole car size compared to the left tire.
created an array and for loop for second tire.
played with numbers until the tire was appropriate distance away
added rectangle
set width and height to radius of tire
filled with color
played with numbers until it fit nicely
repeated steps for the cover of the car
filled with color
created timeline to set speed of car to move across the screen
added buttons and set their action to do appropriate jobs
